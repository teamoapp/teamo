add a team
	we send invitation to the email of the new leader(owner)
	we create a team
	if the user exists we assign as a leader of the team or before create a user

	team/create
	{ "teamName" : "teamo", "email" : "nick@drmnick.com" }
		this will create team with provided name and send the person and invite as for a leader (same exact way), side note we can add to invite bit like firstLeader and have different UI for the invitation screen (in the future) 

add a member
 	search for email in system or send invitation
 	member should have a status to identify to a leader that they are verified

 	in invite we want to store: 
 		Status (pending, accepted, declined, removed)
 		Code the random invitation code
 		Email the email of the user (to check if exists at the time of the acceptance of the invitation)
 		UserId at the time of the creation of the invitaion check if user already exists (if set then should be used insted of the Email field)
 		TeamId 
 		IsLeader store if the invitation was send to add leader or member

 	invitation/create
	{ "email" : "nick@drmnick.com", "isLeader" : false }
		invitation code XYZ1234 would be created and the email address would be associated with it check for existence of the user 

add a leader
	search for email in system or send invitation
 	leader should have a status to identify to a leader that they are verified

	when someone create a team the person becomes a leader of the team
	leader cannot remove himself from the team, so this way we would always have at least one leader
	last leader would be removed at the time when they close the team

	invitation/create
	{ "email" : "nick@drmnick.com", "isLeader" : true }
		invitation code XYZ1234 would be created and the email address would be associated with it check for existence of the user 

respond to the invitation
	screen to respond for the invite and provide optionally phone number with verification

	invitation/check
	check if user was created for the invitation code
	{ "invitationCode" : "XYZ5366" }

		{ "errors" : [{"code" : "invalid", "message": "invitation is not present or already used"}]} accepted/declined status or invitation does not exist
		{ "errors" : [{"code" : "removed", "message": "invitation was removed"}], "teamName" : "teamo" } invitation was removed
		{ "teamName" : "teamo", "firstName" : "nick", "lastName" : "petrus", "isLeader" : false } in this case show greeting screen, associate user with invitation if user exists in the system with the email
		{ "teamName" : "teamo", "isLeader" : false } means that there is no user in the system with the email associated with invitation code and it should be created

	invitation/accept
	{ "invitationCode" : "XYZ1234", "firstName" : "nick", "lastName" : "petrus", "phoneNumber" : "6123828289" }
		the above create user and make them a member of the team
	{ "invitationCode" : "XYZ5366" }
		if user already in the system the it just assign them to the team

	invitation/decline
	{ "invitationCode" : "XYZ5366" }

	UI would be different for Member vs Leader, Invitation is Invalid vs Removed, User exists vs New User


remove 
	member just removes association of a user and a team (member)
	leader just removes association of a user and a team (leader)

	member/remove
	{"memberId" : 1234}
	leader/remove
	{"leaderId" : 1234}
